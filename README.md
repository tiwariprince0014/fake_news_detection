📘 Project Title: Fake News Detector 🧠 Description:

The Fake News Detector is a machine learning–based project designed to identify and classify news articles as real or fake. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text data, extract meaningful features, and detect misleading or false information.

This project aims to combat the spread of misinformation on digital platforms by training a predictive model on a labeled dataset of news articles. The model applies algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Decision Tree to make accurate predictions.

⚙️ Key Features:

Text preprocessing using NLP (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)

Machine learning model training and evaluation

Accurate classification of fake vs. real news

Easy-to-use interface for testing new articles

💻 Technologies Used:

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas & NumPy

Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)

Streamlit / Flask (for deployment, optional)

🎯 Goal:

To create an efficient and reliable tool that helps users verify the authenticity of online news and prevent the spread of misinformation.
